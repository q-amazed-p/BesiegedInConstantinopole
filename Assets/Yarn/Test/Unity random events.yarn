<b>Hunt for the Traitor</b>  <br> Dark shadow falls over your palace as rumours spread of a traitor within your ranks. You suspected that there will be traitors from the very first day of the siege, so you are not suprised. Loukas Notaras, your chief minister, also handles most of matters related to the intelligence efforts. As your intelligence network has {GetInt("spies")} spies, he suggests looking into the rumours. A few days later he reports to you that suspected enemy spy has been identified among the lower ranks of servants of your palace, he is acting strange and has been reported leaving the palace at night. Loukas Notaras asks for your orders on how to deal with the suspected traitor.
<<set $chance = dice(100)>>
-> Conduct a thorough investigation to verify the evidence against the accused and catch him in the act. We need to avoid any possibility of falsely accusing an innocent. However this could leave the traitor an opportunity to escape.
 <<if $chance < 40>>
 After a deeper investigation we find out that the servant appears to be visiting a brothel in secret. While it is a sin, he seems to be no traitor. We are lucky that we have not sentenced an innocent man to death.
 <<elseif $chance < 80>>
 After a deeper investigation we find out that the servant is indeed a traitor - he was pretending to go to a brothel, but in fact, he was sending messages to the Turks, informing them of our food situation and troop morale. As we have witnesses and a proper investigation has been conducted, the spy is brought forward, publicly tried and executed on the walls of the City. While betrayal is a horrible thing, people are impressed by your measured response and the Turks are demoralised by losing their source of information.

 After a deeper investigation we find out that the servant is indeed a traitor - he was pretending to go to a brothel, but in fact, he was sending messages to the Turks, informing them of our food situation and troop morale. Unfortunately, the traitor notices our agents following him and escapes the next night after setting our food stores on fire. We manage to put out the fire, but many barrels of grain were burnt to cinders. This is an unfortunate turn of events, but at least the traitor is no longer reporting from our ranks.
 <<ChangeInt "turk_spies" -1>>
 <<ChangeInt "provisions" -50>>
 <<endif>>
-> There's no time to waste, arrest the traitor and publicly execute him to deter others.
    The accused traitor is apprehended, shackled, and brought forth before you and your court. The atmosphere is thick with solemnity as the crowd gathers to witness the judgment. A hushed tension pervades the air, marking the gravity of the moment. With a voice that carries both authority and a somber acknowledgment of duty, the pronouncement is made by the herald. The traitor shouts out that he is innocent and all of this is a mistake, but executioner's axe cuts his justifications short, together with his head. The people are concerned, both because of the betrayal and because of how quickly and without second thought you dealt with the suspected person. Some start to murmur - what if you were wrong? What if the person in question was actually innocent?
    <<ChangeInt "turk_spies" 1 -1>>
    <<RndChangeFloat "people_rep" -5>>
-> We are not completely sure if he's really a traitor, but we don't have the luxury of investigating. Order our men to simply make him disappear, so that no questions arise.
  Where there is no man, there is no problem. The next time suspected traitor goes for a walk, he simply never returns. You will also never know whether he was a real traitor or merely an unlucky servant.
-> As our focus is Diplomacy & Spycraft, we could confront the suspected spy and offer him to work for us instead, promising him a better reward and harsher punishment if he would refuse. <<if GetInt("Focus") == 4>>
 In the dimly lit chamber, the suspected spy is brought before you, the air heavy with tension and suspicion. As you confront the shadow lurking within your ranks, your offer is simple - great reward or even greater punishment. The spy for a moment considers trying to lie, but your unflinching tone forces him to drop this idea. The traitor drops to his knees and accepts your offer, begging for mercy and simultaneously promising his undying loyalty. While you have little trust for his words, you know that under close supervision of your other agents, this spy could be of great use to you.

</b> Noble ends his life</b> <br> In the shadowed corridors of Constantinople's grand palace, a tragic event transpires as a noble from Doukas family, burdened by undisclosed sorrows, chooses to end his own life, a most un-Christian thing to do. Even worse, he jumped from one of the towers, splattering his brains across half the street below. The news of the noble's demise sends ripples through the court, and the weight of the event falls upon the shoulders of the Emperor. Rumour is that his did this because of a rejection by a lady, but the people may associate this death with conduct of the siege and it could affect the morale negatively if the commoners start thinking that things are so bad that their leadership is killing themselves. As the ruler, you are faced with decision on how to address the tragedy and its aftermath.
 <<ChangeInt cavalry -1>>
-> Announce that heir of Doukas family had an unfortunate accident and declare public mourning, allowing his family to save face and preventing the rumours.
 You choose to publicly acknowledge the noble's passing, holding a grand mourning ceremony to honor his memory. This option emphasizes empathy and solidarity, offering the court and the citizens an opportunity to collectively grieve and find solace. Doukas family is grateful for this interpretation of his death, as it saves them from dishonour and the noble can be buried together with the rest of his family line.
 <<RndChangeFloat noble_rep 5 10>>
 <<RndChangeFloat people_rep -5 -10>>
-> Announce that this poor man was possessed and commited a mortal sin of killing himself. As such, his corpse will need to be hanged, his assets will be confiscated by the Emperor and he will be denied Christian burial.
 You decide that telling the truth is the best course of action, however this means that you need to take all the official secular and religious measures to punish the sinner. People who committed the ultimate sin of killing themselves cannot be buried along other good Christians on hallowed ground, so his body is wrapped in rags and left in the catacombs beneath the City without any ceremony. While seizure of his assets is substantial enough to compensate our efforts, the rest of the nobility is shaken by this event.
 <<RndChangeInt money 1500 3000>>
 <<RndChangeFloat noble_rep -7 -15>>
-> This is a private matter and the Emperor has more pressing issues.
 You decide to leave this matter unaddressed, allowing the people and the nobles to think what they may. While this choice emphasizes maintaining the semblance of stability and shielding the court from having to deal with the problem directly, the rumours spread and mood of both nobles and commoners alike sours.

</b> News from the Fleet </b> <br> Under the cover of night, a small boat reaches the City with news from our fleet.
-> Wonderful, let the messenger in.
 <<if GetInt("Fleet") == 0>>
 We have good news from the fleet - the raiding of the Ottoman shores was successful. While the Ottomans have concentrated their fleet around Constantinople, their coastlines are unprotected. Our brave sailors raided a number of villages and captured a few merchant ships. The plunder was sold to Genoese merchant outpost in Morea and your credit with Genoese banks has been extended. Galata, Genoese colony across the Golden Horn, has in secret informed you that this has been confirmed and they are transferring you the money earned by the actions of your fleet.
 <<elseif GetInt("Fleet") == 1>>
  We have good news from the fleet - your ships have managed to secure food supplies to feed defenders of Constantinople. Getting the food through the Ottoman blockade is a hard task, but a few ships managed to bring in some food under the cover of the night.
 <<elseif GetInt("Fleet") == 2>>
 Some of the ships guarding the Golden Horn have managed to score a few accurate cannon shots on the enemy force that was trying to approach the walls via the coast and inflict serious casualties.
 <<elseif GetInt("Fleet") == 3>>
 We have good news from the fleet - your ships have managed to visit some of the friendly ports around the Mediterranean sea and have brought home volunteers who are eager to join defence of our City.
 <<elseif GetInt("Fleet") == 4>>

 The messenger enters your presence humbly, but then springs towards you screaming 'Your fleet is destroyed, infidel!' and stabs you through the heart. With your last breath you can barely comprehend how could you have been so stupid... GAME OVER

</b> Fire in the City </b> <br> A fierce fire erupts in the heart of the Phanar district near the docks, threatening to consume vast swaths of the City. Dry weather and gusty winds exacerbate the situation, putting both residential areas and crucial infrastructure in danger and we must act fast.
-> Dispatch Troops to quell the fires
 You decide to dispatch well-trained troops equipped with water-soaked blankets and rudimentary firefighting tools to respond to the fire in the Phanar district. Disciplined troops swiftly move to the forefront, forming an efficient line to combat the encroaching flames. The soldiers, guided by their training, manage to contain the blaze effectively, preventing further devastation to residential areas and key structures, however we have casualties and the troops are exhausted.
-> Enlist citizens for bucket brigades
 As the call to action resonates throughout the Phanar district, able-bodied citizens rally to form an impromptu human chain. Armed with buckets filled from available water sources, they combat the encroaching flames threatening their homes and community. The bucket brigade, composed of determined individuals from all walks of life, proves to be a formidable force against the fire. With each passing bucket, they create a continuous stream of water directed at the heart of the blaze. The citizens, working together with shared determination, manage to contain and extinguish smaller outbreaks, preventing the fire from spreading further. However, these people are not trained to deal with something like this and casualties are severe.
-> Sacrifice the district and use demolition to stop the fires from spreading
 With a heavy heart, the decision is made to sacrifice certain sections of the Phanar district by implementing controlled demolitions. Your engineers, guided by a strategic plan, initiate precise demolitions to create firebreaks, effectively cutting off the path of the encroaching flames. As buildings crumble and controlled fires are set to consume predetermined areas, the sacrifice of these sections proves successful in halting the spread of the main inferno. The demolition strategy, while severe, prevents the fire from advancing further into other residential areas and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately among the sacrificed parts of the dockyard district were the warehouses and a lot of materials and provisions were destroyed in the fire.
-> Order the priests to pray in support of our firefighters <<if GetInt("Focus") == 3>>
 A solemn decree is issued to the clergy, urging them to organize processions and prayers in support of the valiant firefighters. The streets reverberate with the echoes of religious chants as priests lead processions through the district, invoking divine intervention to aid those combating the encroaching flames. The collective prayers resonate through the air, creating an atmosphere of spiritual unity among the citizens and the courageous individuals battling the inferno. While the fires take a massive toll, the wind suddenly changes direction and fires seem to dissipate on their own. Was it divine intervention?
