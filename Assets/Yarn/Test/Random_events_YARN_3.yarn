<b>An Uneventful Day</b><br> There's a saying that no news is good news. You only came to really appreciate it when the siege began. Today is a calm day and both you and everyone in the city can just relax for today. Everyone knows that this is calm before the storm, but you appreciate it nonetheless.
-> I will take a walk in the palace garden. One needs to appreciate beauty around us even at times like this.
 People and soldiers are grateful for a calm day of rest and you are more recovered as well.

<b> Desertion to the Monasteries </b> <br>  
As the siege wears on, a disheartening trend emerges as some defenders abandon their posts and seek refuge in the city monasteries. The allure of spiritual sanctuary becomes a potent force, drawing away defenders from the city's walls by giving them false hope that this way they will save themselves. By now some 150 men, primarily archers and infantrymen have sought to hide from their duty. If we let this continue, morale among our troops will fall and many more will follow them in the false hope that they can hide from the horrors of the siege. How shall we deal with this?

-> I shall talk to them in person and call upon their sense of duty to return.
You go to the two biggest monasteries and talk to the deserters, urging them to return to your service, stressing the need for their strength to protect the City. Some deserters are touched by your passionate speech and agree to return. However, others remain sceptical and continue to hide within the safety of the monasteries.
<<Change iInfantry +50>>
<<Change iArchers +25>>
-> Send the Varangian Guard to drag back the deserters and punish them publicly.
The Varangian Guard, known for their loyalty and fearsome reputation, carries out the order with ruthless efficiency. Deserters are forcefully brought back to their posts, and a public punishment spectacle – a mass whipping - is orchestrated to deter further acts of desertion. While this approach instils fear, it may also breed resentment among the defenders, as some sympathize with the harsh treatment of their comrades.

-> Offer rewards to all troops who remained on the walls.
Troops on the walls receive commendations, extra rations, and additional privileges. This approach fosters a sense of unity and encourages defenders to persevere. Some deserters are also incentivised to return to their posts, although very few.

-> Request the monks to shame and kick out the deserters. [Focus: Faith OR Commander: Isidore]  <<if $iFocus == 3 || $iCommander == 7 >>
Monks agree to support you and deserters face public shame and expulsion from the monasteries, impacting their reputation and standing within the community. This approach is not only effective in dissuading others from deserting, but also brings back essentially all deserters back to their posts.

<<Change iArchers +50>>
<<Change fPriestRep +5>>

-> Declare that members of the families of those who deserted will be called up in their stead. [Focus: Mobilisation] <<if $iFocus == 1>>
As families of deserters now face the burden of military service, placing pressure on them to ensure their kin fulfil their duties, there’s some public outcry, but soon absolute majority of the deserters come back to their posts to ensure that their families don’t have to suffer in their stead.

<b> Food Riots in the Merchant Quarter</b> <br>  
As the siege persists, the Merchant Quarter erupts in food riots fuelled by soaring prices and bread shortages. The populace is outraged, demanding immediate action from the Emperor to alleviate their suffering.
-> Implement Price Controls for All Food Sales
The Emperor decides to impose strict price controls on all food items, aiming to make them more accessible to the populace. This move prioritizes affordability but may have consequences for merchants and the overall economy. Short-term relief is provided as prices stabilize, calming the riots. However, soon merchants will reduce their stocks, hiding them or seeking to sell them on the black market, exacerbating existing shortages and effectively reducing the amount of remaining food. The masses do not understand the cause and effect of your policy decisions and love you for your perceived wise decision. Meanwhile the nobility and merchants see the results of your actions and disapprove of them.

<<Change fPeopleRep +6>>
<<Change fNobleRep -3>>
-> Use Force to Disperse Rioters and Restore Order
In a show of authority, the Emperor deploys city guard to forcefully disperse the rioters and restore order. This approach emphasizes maintaining law and order but the people feel that the Emperor is taking side of the rich merchants profiting from the siege. Immediate order is restored, but the use of force does not address underlying issues of food scarcity and high prices, causing anger among the people, although the merchants and the nobility are pleased that even during the siege city’s economy functions as normal.

<<Change fNobleRep +6>>

-> Hand Out Some Food to Appease the Masses
To quell the unrest, the Emperor orders the distribution of limited food supplies among the rioters. This gesture is intended to provide immediate relief and demonstrate empathy for the citizens' plight. The distribution of food temporarily appeases the masses and eases tensions. However, this approach does not address the root causes of the food shortages.
<<Change iFood -100>>
<<Change fPeopleRep +3 >>
->	Order most powerful merchants to form a food price cartel and control the rise of prices. [Focus: War Economy] <<if $iFocus == 2>>
The Emperor engages in negotiations with influential merchants to collaboratively control the rise of prices. This option seeks a cooperative approach between the ruling authority and the economic elite, potentially benefiting both parties. Prices are stabilized through a collaborative effort, providing a middle ground for merchants and citizens. This approach may lead to accusations of favouritism and deepen the divide between the powerful and the people, but we do not care, because the cartel is now easily taxable and will bring in additional taxes every turn.
